abstract = {Consider a Boolean function $\chi: X \to \{0,1\}$ that partitions set $X$ between its good and bad elements, where $x$ is good if $\chi(x)=1$ and bad otherwise. Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A |0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$, measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known, we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {How the displays of bowerbirds have evolved has attracted widespread interest. Endler et al. (2005) analyzed color use in display in a subset of bowerbird species and generalized their results to all bowerbirds. Here we discuss problems with their analysis that calls into question their conclusions. For example, they state that bowerbirds do not use decorations that match their background, but this is not supported by their results. They reconstruct historical patterns of sexual dimorphism in plumage display using questionable methodology. The high lability of these display traits makes these reconstructions unreliable and, using accepted methods and acknowledging the lability problem, we were unable to support their conclusions. Their claim that plumage differences between sympatric species are due to character displacement is not supported by the available data. Their focus is on visual contrast as the cause for display color and we offer additional hypotheses that may contribute to explaining color use. We support studies of spectral analysis of display traits but urge greater care in using this information to reach conclusions about how colorful displays have evolved. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author(s).},

Let x be a complex variable with mean zero and bounded variance. Let Nn be the random matrix of sie n whose entries are iid copies of x and M a deterministic matrix of the same size. The goal of smooth analysis is to estimate the condition number and the least singular value of M + Nn . Spielman and Teng considered the case when x is gaussian. We are going to study the general case when x is arbitrary. Our investigation reveals a new and interesting fact that, unlike the gaussian case, in the general case the "core" matrix M does play a role in the tail bounds for the least singular value of M + N n . Consequently, our estimate involves the norm ∥M∥ and it is a challenging question to determine the right magnitude of this involvement. When ∥M∥ is relatively small, our estimate is nearly optimal and extends or refines several existing result. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer.},

By applying this algorithm inside the inverse power method, we compute approximate Fiedler vectors in a similar amount of time. The algorithm applies subgraph preconditioners in a recursive fashion. These preconditioners improve upon the subgraph preconditioners first introduced by Vaidya in 1990. For any symmetric, weakly diagonally dominant matrix A with nonpositive off-diagonal entries and k ≥ 1, we construct in time O(m logcn) a preconditioner B of A with at most 2(n - 1) + O((m/k) log39 n) nonzero off-diagonal entries such that the finite generalized condition number $\kappa$f(A, B) is at most k, for some other constant c. In the special case when the nonzero structure of the matrix is planar the corresponding linear system solver runs in expected time O(n log2 n + nlogn loglogn log(1/$\epsilon$)). We hope that our introduction of algorithms of low asymptotic complexity will lead to the development of algorithms that are also fast in practice.},

abstract = {Introduction: Accurate self-assessment appears to be difficult and, some would propose, even impossible. Re-cent reviews suggest that peer assessment may be more accurate and that multisource feedback (MSF) may inform self-assessment. We had conducted a series of studies of family physicians in an MSF program including assessments from patients, medical colleagues, and coworkers and self-assessment. Using this body of research, this article explores self-assessment within the social context of multisource feedback and investigates the influ-ence of feedback from peers and others upon self-assessment. Methods: This is a review article in which we synthesized findings of the series of studies with respect to self-assessment, used conclusions to propose a model for self-assessment within a social context, and suggest prac-tical and research implications. Results: Physicians compared peers' and others' assessment feedback with global self-perceptions of perfor-mance. Negative feedback, especially from medical colleagues, that was inconsistent with self-perceptions was not readily reconciled with self-assessments. Multiple internal and environmental factors influenced reconciliation and assimilation of negative feedback. Reflection upon feedback and self-perceptions appeared to be instrumental to reconciliation, and reflection could be facilitated. Discussion: We propose a model of “directed” self-assessment to facilitate the integration of external feedback, especially negative feedback, with self-perceptions and enable its use for practice improvement. Implications for education and research include increasing understanding of ways physicians assimilate external feedback and of the role of educators as facilitators of “directed” self-assessment and self-learning to assist physicians in integrating external feedback.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"{a}}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry - calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
